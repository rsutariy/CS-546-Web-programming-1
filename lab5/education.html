                       <h3>Graduate Study</h3>
                        <p>My school name is Stevens Institute of Technology. </p>
                        <p>I have completed my two semester successfully. </p>
                        <p>My favourite class till now is CS-600. But After taking this course, CS-546 is my favourite class.</p>
                        <p>Till Now, I got <strong>4 GPA </strong> my last two semester. This Experience is different from other two studies because I 
                            am very far from my parents. I learned a lot of things like to make relations with differnt cultural people.
                            I become independent so that decision making skill is developed. These are good things from this thriller experience.</p>
